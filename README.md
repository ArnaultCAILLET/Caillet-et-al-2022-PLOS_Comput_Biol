# Instructions

To run the four-step method, run '1_MAIN_MN_model.py'

To run the iterative validation of the identified spike trains, run '2_MN_Model_validation.py'

To plot and display the results obtained with the four experimental datasets DTA_35, HTA_35, HTA_50, HGM_30, already stored in the Results folder, 
run '3_plot_stored_MN_model_results.py'

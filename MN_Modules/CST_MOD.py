def CST_func(Nb_MN, time, disch_times,unit='sample', fs=2048):
    '''
This function computes the cumulative spike train (CST) from provided 
lists of MN discharge times.

Parameters
----------
$ Nb_MN : the number of discharging MNs involved in the CST, integer
$ time : the time-duration of the CST, array
    time typically covers the entirety of the duration of the experimental 
    data, is in [s] with a 1/fs time step
$ disch_times : the lists of the MN discharge times, matrix
    The discharge times are typically given in samples (fs=2048 Hz in all 
    datasets). 
$ unit : unit of disch_times, string
    As the CST is built in integer samples following fs and not in 
    seconds, it must be specified if disch_times is provided in samples or
    seconds, in which case it is preliminary trasnformed into samples
$ fs : sampling frequency, float
    Typically 2048Hz, this value is consistent with the exp measures. 

Returns
-------
$ Binary_matrix : matrix of the time-location of the MN discharges, matrix
    In each cell (i,t), if the ith MN discharges at time t (in samples), a 
    binary value of 1 is stored, otherwise 0. Example: if the 1st MN 
    discharges at the 4th time sample (i.e. at 4/fs [s]), 
    Binary_matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 1, ...], ...]
$ CST : Cumulative spike train, array
    Array returning at each time instant (in samples) the nb of MNs firing. 
    Example: if the 5 MNs si√πultaneously discharge for the first time at 
    the 4th time sample (i.e. at 4/fs [s]), CST = [0, 0, 0, 5, ...]
